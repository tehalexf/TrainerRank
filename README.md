# Rules
## On Committing
1. Each commit must reference an issue in the following format:
```
#<issue number> <commit message>
```
For example, for this commit, I am working on issue [\#2](https://github.com/tehalexf/TrainerRank/issues/2). My commit message will look like this:
```
#2 Add rules for committing on github
```
**If an issue does not exist for your commit, create one.**
