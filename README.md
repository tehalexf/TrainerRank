# Rules
## On Committing
1. Each commit must reference an issue in the following format:
```
#<JIRA Issue Number> <commit message>
```
For example, for this commit, I am working JIRA issue TR-20. My commit message will look like this:
```
TR-20 Update rules on committing
```
**If an issue does not exist for your commit, create one.**
